# Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one
````python
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than 
  ```` 
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error

 # Python Variables 
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

Example
Variables in Python:

````python
x = 5
    y = "Hello, World!"
````
# Comments
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Example
Comments in Python:

````python
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
````
